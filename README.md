# InfluxDB Measurement Cleanup Script

A Bash script to identify and (optionally) delete InfluxDB 2 measurements that have not been updated for a specified period.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning

- **Explicitly built for the ioBroker Adapter Storage!**
- Use with caution! Deleting measurements is irreversible. BackUp first!
- Always double-check your configuration and selection before confirming deletions.

## üìú Features

1. **Identify Inactive Measurements**
   - Finds measurements that have not been updated for a defined period (e.g., 30 days).

2. **Interactive Confirmation**
   - Lists these measurements and asks for confirmation before deletion.

3. **Selective Deletion**
   - Deletes only the selected measurements using an InfluxDB predicate.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bloop16/influxdb_v2_measurement_clean_Skript.git
